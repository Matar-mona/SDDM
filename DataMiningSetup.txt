HOW TO GUIDE

#1.save unique words in a vector that holds the indexes for the words for the 5000 users

HASH CODE: [ Hi,I,Want,.....]
Index      [0,1,2,3....]


Data Mining txt Format => 5000 rows having Indexing Positions for users + Output vector
1.[100,5] -> [...]
2.[5,10,2000,2550] -> [Tennis]
etc...


#2.implement 10 fold cross validation using k-nearest neigbor
	-advantage of this is to test if model can work without using wikipedia which takes a lot of time to search
	-each user has a prediction vector of topics. if 1 topic of this vector matches 1 topic in the validation vector than this is a HIT. 
	-if vector matches completely this is a FIT. 
	-HIT's are more likely than FIT's
